# SpinePluginImplement
Spine plugin implement for personal project

This plugin requires SpinePlugin as a dependency.
Please check if the plugin is involved in your project.

This is a simple plugin that supports some of the functionalities that are necessary, but not supported in the official plugin of unreal spine2d plugin. 
Since the plugin itself has started as a personal project, It is quite messy when it comes to naming and comments. I apology for that.
